This is the project file for my immersive sim dungeon crawler! Some scripts I'm particularly proud of are the:

1. Character Movement https://github.com/AWillFarah/stealth-crawl/blob/main/Assets/--Scripts--/New%20Systems/Character%20Movement/CharacterMovement.cs
2. Template Item: https://github.com/AWillFarah/stealth-crawl/blob/main/Assets/--Scripts--/New%20Systems/Inventory%20and%20Items/TemplateItem.cs
